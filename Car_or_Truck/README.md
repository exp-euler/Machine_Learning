# Predicting Car or Truck

This folder contains a predictive model built for predicting whether a given
picture contains a car or a truck. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network
that is trained using a dataset of pictures. The main library used is `Skorch`.

## Usage
To run the project locally, first create a **`input/`** directory inside
**`Car_or_Truck/`** by running:
```sh
user@user:~/Machine_Learning/Car_or_Truck$ mkdir input
```
Then, download the training and testing data from
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanholbrook/car-or-truck) and
copy the folders **`train`** and **`valid`** to **`Car_or_Truck/input`**. 
You should be ready to run **`Car_or_Truck.ipynb`** using Jupyter Notebook.
